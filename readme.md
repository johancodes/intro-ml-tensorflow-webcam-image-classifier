It's exciting that Tensorflow.js lets devs make use of a bunch of pre-trained models: https://www.tensorflow.org/js/models
In this experiment, I'm using Tensorflow.js > MobileNet to analyse a live webcam video feed and tell me what it thinks it sees.

Feel free to use my script. I'll really appreciate it if you reference https://github.com/misterlimcodes/intro-ml-tensorflow-webcam-image-classifier if you do.
